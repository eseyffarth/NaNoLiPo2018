# NaNoLiPo
This is the repository for 2018's collaborative NaNoLiPo project.

## What is Oulipo?
Oulipo stands for [_Ouvroir de littérature potentielle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo). It's an approach to creative writing in which you seek inspiration in formal constraints. One of the most famous published works written in oulipo is Georges Perec's [_La Disparition_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Void), a novel that does not contain a single instance of the letter "e".

I've been a fan of constrained writing for years, but only got seriously into it when I joined Mouse Reeve's [oulipo.social](https://oulipo.social), a Mastodon instance that follows Georges Perec's constraint, which means it's impossible to post anything containing an e on the instance.

More recent prior art includes the [Found Poetry Review's NaPoMo project in 2014](http://www.foundpoetryreview.com/oulipost/), which had participants write poems following oulipotic constraints and using linguistic material found in a daily newspaper.

## How does NaNoLiPo work?
The project runs throughout November of 2018. There is a prompt for each day, except that the prompt isn't a prompt, but a constraint. You can participate by writing something inspired by each day's prompt and posting your work as an issue in this repository. Feel free to also/instead post your results on social media, adding the hashtag du jour to make it easy to find your writing!

## Who wins?
Everybody wins. The original [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) has you write 50,000 words; [NaNoGenMo](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2018) has you generate 50,000 words; in NaNoLiPo, the length of your text is not of interest. The only thing that matters is that you are happy with your finished writing that follows the rules of the day.

If you're feeling extra creative, you can combine your NaNoLiPo efforts with another NaNo, for instance by creating a program that generates a text for each prompt, instead of writing the text yourself.
